# About this project
This project aims to show a real-world scenario in which you would read and write to a disk via a Node.js express server rather than a database. This project serves two purposes: to prepare for setting up scalable code and architecture for real-world projects and tie together some of the most popular middleware and utilities found in Node.js projects. Note: project barely touches the surface of what is possible with Nodejs
